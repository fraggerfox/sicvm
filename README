SICvm v0.0.1

Will give a more detailed help file soon. 

But for a quick quide

for windows

make win32 - to compile for windows
make clean_win32 - to clean the binaries

for linux

make linux - to compile for linux
make clean_linux - to clean the binaries

Remember for windows you need MingW32 to compile the source

For futher details on using SICvm refer to MANUAL

NOTE: dos2unix and unix2dos might be required to run on files to
      convert certain text files to proper mode, if not done can cause
      problems in assembler / vm.
